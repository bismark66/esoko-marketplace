### Routing

* @file routerConfig.tsx
 * @description This file exports an array of route definitions for the entire app.
 * Each route definition is an object with the following properties:
 * - path: The path of the route.
 * - element: The component to render on the route.
 * - exact: Whether the route is an exact match.
 * - loader: A function that is called when the route is first loaded. The
 *   function should return a promise that resolves to a string that will be
 *   rendered on the page. This is useful for making API calls to fetch data
 *   that should be displayed on the page.
 * @example
 * {
 *   path: "/",
 *   element: <Home />,
 *   exact: true,
 *   loader: () => fetch("https://example.com/api/data").then(res => res.text()),
 * }
